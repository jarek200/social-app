## Remaining Issues (4 warnings - false positives)

These are **false positives** where the linter incorrectly reports unused variables that ARE actually used in Astro templates:

1. `BaseLayout.astro:5` - `title` variable (used in line 16)
2. `BaseLayout.astro:6` - `description` variable (used in line 17)
3. `BaseLayout.astro:7` - `showNav` variable (used in line 25)
4. `post/[id].astro:11` - `item` variable (used throughout the template)

These can be safely ignored as they are Astro-specific template usage that Biome doesn't understand.
