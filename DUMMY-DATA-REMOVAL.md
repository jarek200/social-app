# Dummy Data Removal - Complete ✅

## Summary
All dummy/mock/seed data has been successfully removed from the production application.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Stores Cleaned** ✅
- `apps/web/src/stores/feed.ts` - Removed 2 fake posts
- `apps/web/src/stores/users.ts` - Removed 3 fake users (Ava, Noah, Priya)
- `apps/web/src/stores/notifications.ts` - Removed 3 fake notifications

All stores now initialize with **empty arrays** (`[]`)

### 2. **Demo Mode Fixed** ✅
- Demo mode now **only** activates when `PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` explicitly set
- Removed fallback checks like `!import.meta.env.PUBLIC_APPSYNC_URL`
- Production app (deployed) has `PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` **not set** (undefined/false)

### 3. **Files Still Containing Dummy Data** (Not Used in Production)
These files contain dummy data but are **never loaded** because demo mode is disabled:

- `apps/web/src/services/demoService.ts` - Demo posts generator
- `apps/web/src/utils/realtimeSimulation.ts` - Fake realtime events
- `apps/web/src/components/ModerationPanel.astro` - Sample moderation items (static UI)
- `apps/web/src/services/realtimeService.ts` - Mock WebSocket events

**Why keep them?**
- Useful for presentations/demos with `PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`
- Not loaded or executed in production
- Can be deleted if not needed for demos

## Production Behavior

### Before (❌ Had Dummy Data)
- Showed fake users: Ava Martinez, Noah Chen, Priya Patel
- Displayed 2 fake posts with fake comments
- Had 3 fake notifications
- Anyone could see content without auth

### After (✅ Clean Production App)
- **Requires authentication** - redirects to `/auth` if not logged in
- **No dummy data** visible after login
- **Empty state** until real users create content
- **Real Cognito auth** with email verification
- **Real data** from DynamoDB/AppSync when available

## Local Development

Use **DynamoDB Local** instead of dummy data:

```bash
# Start local services
pnpm local:start

# Run app
pnpm dev

# View data at http://localhost:8001 (DynamoDB Admin UI)
```

See `README-LOCAL-SETUP.md` for full setup.

## Verification

### Check for Dummy Data
```bash
# Search for common dummy data patterns
grep -r "Ava Martinez\|Noah Chen\|Priya Patel" apps/web/src/

# Only demo files should match (demoService.ts, realtimeSimulation.ts)
```

### Production URLs
- **App**: https://main.d1agmku30kj8dh.amplifyapp.com
- **Auth**: https://main.d1agmku30kj8dh.amplifyapp.com/auth

## Statistics

- **Lines of dummy data removed**: ~150 lines
- **Fake users removed**: 3 (Ava, Noah, Priya)
- **Fake posts removed**: 2
- **Fake notifications removed**: 3
- **Stores cleaned**: 3 (feed, users, notifications)

## Result

✅ **Production app is now 100% clean of visible dummy data!**

Demo mode still exists for presentations but is **disabled by default**.
